What an absolute disappointment. I just moved into the metro and I'm beyond disappointed. This place is disgusting. My unit was neither renovated for a new resident or cleaned prior to my move-in. The kitchen has gross. There are still grease stains on the stove control panel from the previous resident. There are grease stains underneath the microwave. The cupboards and drawers have stains and debris from the previous occupant. There is dusted caked in the window sills, on the AC vent, and baseboards. There was a massive grease stain left on my balcony from a grill from the previous resident. The repair work is shoddy. There are nail holes all over the place that haven't been filled or painted over. My move-in inspection list is extensive because this place is garbage and is not worth the rent that is charged. The common areas in building two are dingy, dirty, and not well kept. The parking garage is dirty and has cobwebs hanging from the ceiling.
