Hi Brittany,

I was able to get a few quotes for movers over the last few days. This same move took only two hours when I moved into the metro. I canâ€™t imagine it will be any different moving to the next one. I believe these have a two hour minimum. Fantastic movers is who I used to move to the metro. I did get a 4th quote but it was more than double these quotes below.
